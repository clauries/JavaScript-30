    <h1>Landing Page - Rough Draft</h1>
    <!-- 
        Will eventually have a navbar
        Will eventually be styled
        Currently just want to get a list created and a place to add projects

    <h3>What is JavaScript 30?</h3>
    <p>This is a challenge created by Wes Bos to help develop consistent coding habits over the course of 30 days. Each day has a tutorial that is less than 30 minutes. Each tutorial covers a vanilla JavaScript concept that is useful for everyday coding. </p>

    <h3>Why JavaScript 30?</h3>
    <p>I graduated from a coding bootcamp in April. Since then, stress from the pandemic, engaging with human rights issues, and taking care of my 2 year old w/out daycare have derailed my study habits. With some restructuring of my time & getting help from family, I'm setting out to reestablish coding habits and restore my coding confidence as I move forward in my job search/freelancing.</p>
    
    <h3>What's your timeline?</h3>
    <p>I technically started this months ago, so I have a couple of the projects under my belt. My goal is to complete 1 tutorial every week day for 30 days.</p>
    <p>October 5th, 2020 is my official end date (so I have a day or 2 of wiggle room).</p>
    <p>By then, all 30 of the projects below should have a link and hopefully this page will be styled.</p>
