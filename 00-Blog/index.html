        Hi! I'm Laurie. We may or may not have met before. But you're about to look in on a little experiement I'm trying.
    </p>
    <p>
        You see, in October 2019 I left my job to go to coding bootcamp. I graduated in April with tons of new knowledge, some slowly sinking confidence, 
        and what little will power I had left after adapting to life in a pandemic with a toddler. We then sailed into a major human rights movement that 
        I've been engaging with and doing some hard inner work around. Then my counselor and I dug into some deep emotional spaces. Then daycare closed. 
        To sum it up: it's been a rough summer. My motivation is down. My confidence in getting a job is quite low. And I haven't been coding much at all.
    </p> 
    <p>
        So I'm trying this experiment. Maybe if I blog & tweet & post & create a website around this challenge, I will stick to something. Maybe I'll establish some
        better habits. Maybe I'll remember I can code and know what I'm doing. And maybe I'll learn how to do some cool but simple things in vanilla JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is going to be challenging for me though. Like many others, I have struggled to keep up routines and failed at follow-through on many of things during the 
        pandemic. Just google stress & routines to see how our levels of stress affect our abilities to move forward on things. I guess I am trying to fight back with
        this project and am willing to give myself a lot of grace when I inevitably fail at something (at which time I will commence repeating the mantra, "It's ok to 
        fail").
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks for following along. It does mean a lot to me to have some form of accountability. If you're also doing this challenge, please @mommacoder on any of your 
        twitter posts or tag me on LinkedIn. I'd love to see your work!
