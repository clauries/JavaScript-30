    <h2>Welcome to a Test of Will</h2>
    <h3>Days 1-2</h3>
    <h3>25 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
        Hi! I'm Laurie. We may or may not have met before. But you're about to look in on a little experiement I'm trying.
    </p>
    <p>
        You see, in October 2019 I left my job to go to coding bootcamp. I graduated in April with tons of new knowledge, some slowly sinking confidence, 
        and what little will power I had left after adapting to life in a pandemic with a toddler. We then sailed into a major human rights movement that 
        I've been engaging with and doing some hard inner work around. Then my counselor and I dug into some deep emotional spaces. Then daycare closed. 
        To sum it up: it's been a rough summer. My motivation is down. My confidence in getting a job is quite low. And I haven't been coding much at all.
    </p> 
    <p>
        So I'm trying this experiment. Maybe if I blog & tweet & post & create a website around this challenge, I will stick to something. Maybe I'll establish some
        better habits. Maybe I'll remember I can code and know what I'm doing. And maybe I'll learn how to do some cool but simple things in vanilla JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is going to be challenging for me though. Like many others, I have struggled to keep up routines and failed at follow-through on many of things during the 
        pandemic. Just google stress & routines to see how our levels of stress affect our abilities to move forward on things. I guess I am trying to fight back with
        this project and am willing to give myself a lot of grace when I inevitably fail at something (at which time I will commence repeating the mantra, "It's ok to 
        fail").
    </p>
    <p>
        Thanks for following along. It does mean a lot to me to have some form of accountability. If you're also doing this challenge, please @mommacoder on any of your 
        twitter posts or tag me on LinkedIn. I'd love to work alongside you!

    <h2>CSS Manipulation using JS</h2>
    <h3>Day 3</h3>
    <h3>26 August 2020</h3>
    <p>
        CSS is still a bit of a mystery to me. I have a book I need to crack open from the library about HTML & CSS. This is definitely an easy way to manipulate the
        styling though. It's a bit like using the styling in Material-UI. There you have an object containing your style guide. You can
        change or manipulate those styles within components for that specific component or for the general style. Before today I did not know you could style this way
        using CSS. Will definitely explore more.
    </p>
    <p>
        Personally, I almost did not get on today. We're trying a new discipline method with our son. He's not outright defiant, but passive aggressive. I didn't realize
        how much harder it would be to discipline someone who is being completely pleasant, but just not following directions. It's draining. I'm tired. But like diciplining
        a child, consistency is key in habit formation. So I got on. You can get on too. Even just doing a small lesson like the one I did today will build habits. 
    </p>

        Thanks for following along on this journey!

    <h2>Array Cardio Day</h2>
    <h3>Day 4</h3>
    <h3>27 August 2020</h3>

    <p>
        *Whew* That was tiring. Part way through the activity things stopped making sense. I kept reading and re-reading the prompt, but couldn't figure out what I was supposed
        to do. I then realized it was past dinner time and my brain was just needing sustenance. So this is a public service announcement: if you can't understand something
        check in with your body and the clock to see if you need something: food, water, a nap - you get the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
        Honestly, this was very good for me. Array methods have been difficult for me to understand. I am looking forward to round 2 to go a bit deeper. I've been doing some 
        algorithm work on <a href="https://edabit.com/challenges/javascript" target="_blank"> Edabit </a> to help improve in this area. 
        <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array" target="_blank">MDN</a> is also my go-to docs for clarifying and learning about the 
        array methods. What resources have you found most helpful?
